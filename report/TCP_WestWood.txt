TCP BIC Implementation:

Objective:
Design TCP WestWood as defined in [7], which follows the guidelines mentioned:
1. N, represents the congestion state of network using RTT
2. Beta, parameter to discretize the congestion state


Implementation:

Window decrease function of WestWood uses the following function:

if (N < B):
	ssthres = cwnd*4/5.0
else:
	ssthres = cwnd/2.0
cwnd = ssthres

Window growth function of BIC uses the following function:

if N < B:
	increase = 1/cwnd
else:
	increase = 2/cwnd

window_size = window_size + increase/window_size

To make RTT better, filter is used.

Development:
WestWood is completely implemented using the code mentioned above which we obatained from [7].

Testing:
The pilot test is performed between a DELL laptop and a ASUS laptop that are connected by a wireless link (IITD-WIFI)
A lot of test were ran and some results, which we think give a fair estimate of the protocol are displayed in the results section.
