TCP BIC Implementation:

Objective:
Design TCP BIC as defined in [6], which follows the guidelines mentioned:
1. Wmax, represents the estimated max window size
2. Beta, signifies the window decrease constant for mulitplicative decrease
3. Smax, Smin, the cap for window increase

Implementation:

Window growth function of BIC uses the following function:

if window_size < Wmax:
	increase = (Wmax - window_size)/2.0
else:
	increase = (window_size - Wmax)
if increase > Smax:
	increase = Smax
elif increase < Smin:
	increase = Smin

window_size = window_size + increase/window_size


Development:
BIC is completely implemented using the code mentioned above which we obatained from [6].

Remaining Same as TCP CUBIC (Without implementation part)
